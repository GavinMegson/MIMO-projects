Sounder/

This folder includes a library of code for running channel sounding
experiments with an ArgosV3 base station. To run, follow steps below:

Edit base station input config file (e.g. conf/tddconfig.json): 

- This file contains all the configurations you need for your channel 
  sounding experiment on the base station side. 
  * "hubs" specifies the file containing the serial number of ArgosV3
     hubs (mutiple hubs in case of a multi-cell experiment).
  * "irises" specifies the name of the file serial number of all 
    Irises you wish to use in the experiment in the base station.
  * "cells" determines the number of cells (ArgosV3) base stations
    in the experiment.
  * "frequency" operating center frequency.
  * "rxgain" receive gain to be used on each radio.
  * "txgain" transmit gain to be used on each radio (PAD).
  * "rate" operating bandwidth for all radios.
  * "symbol_size" the number of samples in each symbol in TDD mode.
  * "prefix" prefix length i.t.o number of samples in each symbol.
  * "postfix" postfix length i.t.o number of samples in each symbol.
  * "frames" format of each frame (mode for each symbol). "B" identifies
    a symbol as beacon. "G" is guard band, "P" is pilot, "U" is uplink
    and "D" is downlink. 
 
Edit user terminal(s) input config file (e.g. conf/userconfig.json):

- Similar to above with the addition of serials label
  * "serials" specifies the serial numbers of all 
    Irises you wish to use as user terminals in the experiment.
  * "coeffs" coefficients of the correlator to be loaded in the users' FPGAs
  * "pilot" pilot signal to be sent by the users' to the base station
  * "txdata" tx signal to be sent by the users' to the base station (if uplink is enabled, i.e. 'T' symbols)
 
NOTE 1: Multi-cell case is currently not implemented. 
NOTE 2: The format of "frames" entry in tddconfig.json is slightly 
        different from what is used in user config file and python code (setupUE.py). Here 
        downlink, uplink and beacon signals are distinguished.
NOTE 3: Beacon signal is loaded from beacon.txt. The length of data must 
        match symbol_size.
NOTE 4: Currently, the number of users is extracted from the number of 
        pilots in frames entry. This could change in the future, as
        every 16 consecutive frames can be programmed separately and
        each frame could have a different number of pilots with users
        are scheduled to send pilots at different frames.
NOTE 5: Currently users are setup separately from the base station
      To ensure correct behavior, first setup the users (below) before running sounder
      code.

cmake ./
make -j
./user conf/userconfig.json
./sounder conf/tddconfig/json
